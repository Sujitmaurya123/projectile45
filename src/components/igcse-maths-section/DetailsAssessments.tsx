                  <ul className='list-disc'>

                  <li>All candidates take two components.</li>
                  <li>Candidates who have studied the Core subject content, or who are expected to achieve a grade D or below, should be entered for Paper 1 and Paper 3. These candidates will be eligible for grades C to G.</li>
                  <li>Candidates who have studied the Extended subject content and who are expected to achieve a grade C or above should be entered for Paper 2 and Paper 4. These candidates will be eligible for grades A to E.</li>
                  <li>All papers assess AO1 Knowledge and understanding of mathematical techniques and AO2 Analyse, interpret and communicate mathematically.</li>
                  <li>All papers consist of structured and unstructured questions. Structured questions contain parts, e.g. (a), (b), (c), etc., and unstructured questions do not.</li>
                  <li>Questions may assess more than one topic from the subject content.</li>
                  <li>For all papers, candidates write their answers on the question paper. They must show all necessary working in the spaces provided.</li>
                 
                 </ul>
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Additional materials for exams</h3>
                  <p>For both Core and Extended papers, candidates should have the following geometrical instruments:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                      <li>a pair of compasses</li>
                      <li>a protractor</li>
                      <li>a ruler.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul className='list-disc'>

                  <li>Tracing paper may be used as an additional material for all four papers. Candidates cannot bring their own tracing paper but may request it during the examination.</li>
                  <li>Candidates should have a scientific calculator for Papers 3 and 4; one with trigonometric functions is strongly recommended. Algebraic or graphical calculators are not permitted. Please see the Cambridge Handbook at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide for guidance on use of calculators in the examinations.</li>
                  <li>Calculators are not allowed for Paper 1 and Paper 2.</li>
                  <li>The Additional materials list for exams is updated before each series. You can view the list for the relevant series and year on our website in the Phase 4 - Before the exams section of the Cambridge Exams Officer&apos;s Guide at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide.</li>

                      <li>have each point plotted to an accuracy of within half of the smallest square on the grid.</li>
                  </ul>

                      <li>have labelled axes, e.g. with x and y</li>
                      <li>interact with the axes appropriately, e.g. by intersecting or by tending towards</li>
                      <li>fall within the correct quadrants</li>
                      <li>show the correct long-term behaviour.</li>
                  </ul>

                  </ul>
                  <li>A tangent to a curve should touch the curve at the required point and be in contact with the curve for the minimum possible distance. It should not cross the curve at the point where it is a tangent.</li>
                  <li>Values should be read off a graph to an accuracy of within half of the smallest square on the grid.</li>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 bg-red-100 text-headingcol">Communicating mathematically</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                  <li>If candidates are asked to show their working, they cannot gain full marks without clearly communicating their method, even if their final answer is correct.</li>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-headingcol">Accuracy</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Answers are expected to be given in their simplest form unless the question states otherwise.</li>
                  <li>Where a question asks for &apos;xact value&apos;, the answer may need to be given in terms of π or in surd form, depending on the question.</li>
                  <li>Where answers are not exact values, they should be given to three significant figures unless a different accuracy is defined in the question.</li>
                  <li>Answers that are exact to four or five significant figures should <b>not</b> be rounded unless the question states otherwise.</li>
                  <li>In order to obtain an answer correct to an appropriate degree of accuracy, a higher degree of accuracy will often be needed within the working.</li>
                  <li>If a question asks to prove or show a given answer to a specified degree of accuracy, candidates must show full working, intermediate answers and the final answer to at least one degree of accuracy more than that asked for.</li>

              <p>This section is an overview of other information you need to know about this syllabus. It will help to share the administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more information about our administrative processes at www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide</p>

              <h4>Before you start</h4>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                  <li><b>Previous study</b></li>
                  <p>We recommend that learners starting this course should have studied a mathematics curriculum such as the Cambridge Lower Secondary programme or equivalent national educational framework.</p>
                  <li><b>Guided learning hours</b></li>
                  <p>We design Cambridge IGCSE syllabuses to require about 130 guided learning hours for each subject. This is for guidance only. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the qualification may vary according to each school and the learners&apos; previous experience of the subject.</p>
              </ul>

              <h4>Availability and timetables</h4>
              <p>All Cambridge schools are allocated to one of six administrative zones. Each zone has a specific timetable.</p>
              <p>You can view the timetable for your administrative zone at <a href="www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables">www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables</a></p>
              <p>You can enter candidates in the June and November exam series. If your school is in India, you can also enter your candidates in the March exam series.</p>
              <p>Check you are using the syllabus for the year the candidate is taking the exam.</p>
              <p>Private candidates can enter for this syllabus. For more information, please refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries.</p>

              <h4>Combining with other syllabuses</h4>
              <p>Candidates can take this syllabus alongside other Cambridge International syllabuses in a single exam series.</p>
              <p>The only exceptions are:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Cambridge IGCSE (9-1) Mathematics (0980)</li>

                  <li>Cambridge O Level Mathematics (4024)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>syllabuses with the same title at the same level.</p>
              <p>Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge IGCSE (9-1) and Cambridge O Level syllabuses are at the same level.</p>

              <h4>Group awards: Cambridge ICE</h4>
              <p>Cambridge ICE (International Certificate of Education) is a group award for Cambridge IGCSE. It allows schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum by recognising the achievements of learners who pass exams in a range of different subjects.</p>

              <h4>Making entries</h4>
              <p>Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work closely with you to ensure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide.</p>

              <h4>Exam administration</h4>
              <p>To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to an administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available assessment options.</p>

              <h4>Support for exams officers</h4>
              <p>We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at <a href="www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide">www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide</a></p>

              <h4>Retakes</h4>
              <p>Candidates can retake the whole qualification as many times as they want to. Information on retake entries is at <a href="www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes">www.cambridgeinternational.org/retakes</a></p>

              <h4>Language</h4>
              <p>This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only.</p>

              <h4>Accessibility and equality</h4>
              <h5>Syllabus and assessment design</h5>
              <p>Cambridge International works to avoid direct or indirect discrimination. We develop and design syllabuses and assessment materials to maximise inclusivity for candidates of all national, cultural or social backgrounds and candidates with protected characteristics; these protected characteristics include special educational needs and disability, religion and belief, and characteristics related to gender and identity. In addition, the language and layout are designed to make our materials as accessible as possible. This gives all candidates the fairest possible opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding and helps to minimise the requirement to make reasonable adjustments during the assessment process.</p>

              <h5>Access arrangements</h5>
              <p>Access arrangements (including modified papers) are the principal way in which Cambridge International complies with our duty, as guided by the UK Equality Act (2010), to make &apos;reasonable adjustments&apos; for candidates with special educational needs (SEN), disability, illness or injury. Where a candidate would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to a candidate with no SEN, disability, illness or injury, we may be able to agree pre-examination access arrangements. These arrangements help a candidate by minimising accessibility barriers and maximising their opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding in an assessment.</p>

                  <li><b>Important:</b></li>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                      <li>Requested access arrangements should be based on evidence of the candidate&apos;s barrier to assessment and should also reflect their normal way of working at school; this is in line with the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide</li>
                      <li>For Cambridge International to approve an access arrangement, we will need to agree that it constitutes a reasonable adjustment, involves reasonable cost and timeframe and does not affect the security and integrity of the assessment.</li>
                      <li>Availability of access arrangements should be checked by centres at the start of the course. Details of our standard access arrangements and modified question papers are available in the Cambridge Handbook www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide</li>
                      <li>Please contact us at the start of the course to find out if we are able to approve an arrangement that is not included in the list of standard access arrangements.</li>
                      <li>Candidates who cannot access parts of the assessment may be able to receive an award based on the parts they have completed.</li>

              <h4>After the exam</h4>

              <h4>Grading and reporting</h4>
              <p>Grades A*, A, B, C, D, E, F or G indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge IGCSE.</p>
              <p>A* is the highest and G is the lowest. ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard required for grade G. ‘Ungraded’ may be reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate.</p>
              <p>In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Q (PENDING)</li>
                  <li>X (NO RESULT).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These letters do not appear on the certificate.</p>
              <p>On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge IGCSE is shown as INTERNATIONAL GENERAL CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (IGCSE).</p>

              <h4>How students and teachers can use the grades</h4>
              <p>Assessment at Cambridge IGCSE has two purposes:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li>to measure learning and achievement</li>
                  <p>The assessment confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions.</p>
                  <li>to show likely future success</li>
                  <p>The outcomes help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are more likely to be successful.</p>
                  <p>The outcomes help students choose the most suitable course or career.</p>
              </ol>

              <h4>Grade descriptions</h4>
              <p>Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better performance in some other aspect.</p>
              <p>Grade descriptions for Cambridge IGCSE Mathematics will be published after the first assessment of the syllabus in 2025.</p>
