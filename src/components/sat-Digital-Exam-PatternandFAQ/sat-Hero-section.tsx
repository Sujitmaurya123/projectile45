                        The <strong className='text-gray-700'>SAT Exam Pattern</strong> for the year 2024-2025 has undergone major changes to
                        better align with the skills required for college success. The test now scores between
                        400 and 1600 points, with no negative marking for incorrect answers, allowing you to
                        focus on accuracy without worrying about penalties.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base text-justify md:text-lg leading-relaxed ">
                        One significant update is the reduced overall exam duration, making the test more
                        streamlined and efficient. Another improvement is the allowance of calculators for all
                        Math questions, including access to the <strong className='text-gray-700'>Desmos graphing calculator</strong> directly on
                        the test platform. This feature provides enhanced flexibility and tools for solving
                        complex problems.

                        Additionally, the SAT now includes a consolidated Reading and Writing section,
                        simplifying time management and test strategy. The redesigned exam evaluates your
                        ability to analyze information, solve problems, and think criticallyâ€”skills essential for
                        academic success. Familiarizing yourself with these changes in the SAT Exam
