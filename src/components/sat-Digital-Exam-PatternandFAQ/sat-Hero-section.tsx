                        The <strong>SAT exam pattern</strong> for 2025 has been redesigned to make the test more
                        efficient, adaptive, and aligned with essential college-ready skills. Whether you&#39;re
                        preparing with a <strong>Digital SAT practice</strong> test or enrolling in a <strong>SAT prep course,</strong>
                        understanding these updates is crucial for achieving your target score.

                        One significant update is the reduced overall exam duration, making the test more
                        streamlined and efficient. Another improvement is the allowance of calculators for all
                        Math questions, including access to the <strong className='text-gray-700'>Desmos graphing calculator</strong> directly on
                        the test platform. This feature provides enhanced flexibility and tools for solving
                        complex problems.

                        Additionally, the SAT now includes a consolidated Reading and Writing section,
                        simplifying time management and test strategy. The redesigned exam evaluates your
                        ability to analyze information, solve problems, and think criticallyâ€”skills essential for
                        academic success. Familiarizing yourself with these changes in the SAT Exam
                        Pattern will help you plan effectively and maximize your score.
