                The 80/20 Rule for GMAT Focus Edition: Study Smart, Score High
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Preparing for the GMAT Focus Edition can be daunting, but what if you could maximize your score with less effort? The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 Rule, suggests that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. By strategically focusing on high-yield topics and efficient study methods, you can significantly improve your GMAT score without wasting time on low-impact areas.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                <strong>How the 80/20 Rule Applies to GMAT Focus Edition</strong><br />
                The GMAT Focus Edition eliminates Sentence Correction and the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), making Quantitative Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Data Insights the primary areas of focus. This means prioritizing the right topics and strategies is crucial for achieving a high score.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">1. Focus on High-Yield GMAT Topics (20%) for Maximum Score Improvement (80%)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Understanding which topics yield the highest returns is key to GMAT success.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">📊 Quantitative Reasoning: Key Focus Areas</h3>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li>Data Sufficiency Mastery (Learn how to determine if the information given is enough to solve a problem.)</li>
                <li>Algebra & Equations (Linear equations, inequalities, quadratic equations.)</li>
                <li>Word Problems (Rates, ratios, percentages, and work problems.)</li>
                <li>Statistics & Number Properties (Mean, median, standard deviation, and prime numbers.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>💡 Skip:</strong> Complex geometry and combinatorics—these topics are rarely tested!
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">📖 Verbal Reasoning: Key Focus Areas</h3>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li>Critical Reasoning (CR) (Strengthen/weaken arguments, find assumptions, and evaluate arguments.)</li>
                <li>Reading Comprehension (RC) (Main ideas, inference-based questions, tone, and detail-oriented questions.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>💡 No Sentence Correction!</strong> This means focusing on logic-based reasoning rather than grammar.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">📈 Data Insights: Key Focus Areas</h3>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li>Data Interpretation (Charts, graphs, tables, and trend analysis.)</li>
                <li>Multi-Source Reasoning (Combining different data sets to draw conclusions.)</li>
                <li>Table Analysis (Sorting and filtering large amounts of information.)</li>
                <li>Two-Part Analysis (Logical reasoning and numerical interpretation.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>💡 Avoid:</strong> Overcomplicating calculations—focus on estimation and mental math shortcuts instead.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">2. Quality Over Quantity: Smart Practice</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Practicing hundreds of questions without reviewing your mistakes is ineffective. Your biggest improvements will come from error analysis.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li>✔ Maintain an error log 📓—Track mistakes and note corrections.</li>
                <li>✔ Identify patterns 🔍—Recognize recurring errors and address weaknesses.</li>
                <li>✔ Review mistakes strategically—80% of improvement comes from analyzing past errors, not just solving more problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">3. Master Adaptive Testing & Time Management</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                The GMAT Focus Edition consists of only 64 questions, down from 80, and allows section selection. This makes time management and strategic answering more important than ever.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li>✔ Time-Saving Strategies: Know when to skip tough questions and move on.</li>
                <li>✔ Answer Elimination Techniques: Reduce answer choices to improve accuracy.</li>
                <li>✔ Mental Math & Estimation: Reduce reliance on long calculations to save time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">4. Use Official GMAT Resources Strategically</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                To apply the 80/20 rule effectively, stick to the best GMAT preparation materials:
            </p>
