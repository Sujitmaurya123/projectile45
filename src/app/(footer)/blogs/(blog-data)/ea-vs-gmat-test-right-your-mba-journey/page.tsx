                EA vs. GMAT: Which Test is Right for Your MBA Journey?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Deciding between the Executive Assessment (EA) and the GMAT can be challenging, especially if you&apos;re planning to apply for an MBA program. Both exams assess business school readiness, but they cater to different applicants. This guide will help you understand their similarities, differences, and which one aligns best with your career goals.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Similarities Between the EA & GMAT</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                While the EA and GMAT have distinct purposes, they share several common features:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li><strong>Designed for Business School Admissions:</strong> Both tests evaluate quantitative, verbal, and analytical skills necessary for success in MBA programs. Whether you aim for a full-time MBA or an Executive MBA (EMBA), one of these tests will likely be required.</li>
                <li><strong>Similar Question Types:</strong> The EA and GMAT assess candidates in three main areas:
                    <ul className="list-inside ml-6">
                        <li><strong>Verbal Reasoning:</strong> Reading comprehension and critical reasoning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Reasoning:</strong> Problem-solving and data sufficiency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrated/Data Insights:</strong> Table analysis, multi-source reasoning, and graphical interpretation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Computer-Adaptive Format:</strong> Both exams use adaptive testing, adjusting question difficulty based on performance. However, the adaptation method differs, which we will discuss later.</li>
                <li><strong>No Advanced Math Required:</strong> Neither test includes calculus or higher-level mathematics. Instead, they focus on high-school-level algebra, arithmetic, and data analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Testing Options:</strong> Both exams are available for online and in-person testing, providing flexibility for busy professionals.</li>
            </ul>
