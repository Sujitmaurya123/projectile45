                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">1. Understand the Digital SAT Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Digital SAT is section-adaptive, meaning your performance in the first module determines the difficulty of the second module. The test consists of two main sections:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li><strong>Reading & Writing (RW):</strong> Features shorter, information-dense passages with focused comprehension and grammar questions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Math:</strong> Allows a calculator throughout the section, emphasizing algebra, problem-solving, and data analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Familiarizing yourself with this structure is the first step to SAT success. Projectile 45 Tuition offers expert-led Digital SAT courses that help students navigate the test’s unique format efficiently.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">2. Focus on High-Yield Topics</h2>
                    <p>Apply the 80/20 rule—focus on the topics that contribute the most to your score. For the Reading & Writing section, prioritize:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Main idea and inference questions (short passages)</li>
                        <li>Grammar and sentence structure (concise writing)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the Math section, concentrate on:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Algebra (linear equations, functions, systems of equations)</li>
                        <li>Data Analysis (ratios, percentages, probability)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since the Digital SAT has removed obscure vocabulary questions, shift your attention to reading comprehension and logical reasoning.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">3. Take Full-Length Adaptive Practice Tests</h2>
                    <p>Practice tests simulate real exam conditions and improve your confidence. Use the College Board’s Bluebook™ app for official Digital SAT simulations.</p>
                    <p>Take at least three full-length tests before your exam. Familiarize yourself with the built-in timer, annotation tool, and Desmos calculator.</p>
                    <p>For additional test simulations, Projectile 45 Tuition provides customized SAT mock tests with performance analysis.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">4. Develop Time Management Strategies</h2>
                    <p>Since the Digital SAT is shorter than previous versions, efficient pacing is crucial.</p>
                    <p>Practice under timed conditions to improve speed and accuracy.</p>
                    <p>Use answer elimination strategies to identify the correct choice faster.</p>
                    <p>Prioritize accuracy in the first module to get a higher-difficulty second module.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">5. Leverage Online SAT Prep Resources</h2>
                    <p>Quality SAT prep resources can make a huge difference. Some of the best options include:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Projectile 45 Tuition’s Digital SAT courses, which provide structured lessons, one-on-one coaching, and detailed feedback to enhance your performance.</li>
                        <li>The Khan Academy SAT Prep, which offers free official SAT practice questions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">6. Improve Mental Math Skills</h2>
                    <p>While the SAT allows a calculator for the entire Math section, relying too much on it can slow you down. Strengthen your mental math skills for:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Ratios, percentages, and algebraic calculations</li>
                        <li>Quick estimations to check answer choices efficiently</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">7. Review Mistakes from Practice Tests</h2>
                    <p>Simply taking practice tests isn’t enough—you need to analyze your mistakes. After each test, review:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Incorrect answers to identify patterns.</li>
                        <li>Time spent per question to improve efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Weak areas that require additional practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Projectile 45 Tuition provides personalized test reviews, helping students pinpoint errors and refine their strategies.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">8. Build Reading Stamina</h2>
                    <p>The Reading & Writing section demands quick comprehension of dense, information-packed passages. Strengthen your reading skills by:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Reading editorials, research papers, and academic articles.</li>
                        <li>Summarizing passages to improve retention and analysis.</li>
                        <li>Practicing active reading strategies like annotation and skimming.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">9. Stick to a Consistent Study Plan</h2>
                    <p>A structured study schedule ensures steady progress. Create a plan that includes:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>1-2 hours of SAT prep daily.</li>
                        <li>Alternating between Math and Reading & Writing to balance learning.</li>
                        <li>Weekly goals to track improvement and stay motivated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">10. Stay Healthy and Well-Rested</h2>
                    <p>Your brain needs rest to function at its best. Before test day, make sure to:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.</li>
                        <li>Eat brain-boosting foods like nuts, fruits, and protein-rich meals.</li>
                        <li>Practice mindfulness or light exercise to reduce stress.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
