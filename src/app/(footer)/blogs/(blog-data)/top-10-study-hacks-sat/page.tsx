                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">1. Understand the Digital SAT Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Digital SAT is section-adaptive, meaning your performance in the first module determines the difficulty of the second module. The test consists of two main sections:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Reading & Writing (RW): Shorter passages with focused questions.</li>
                        <li>Math: Calculator allowed for the entire section.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">2. Focus on High-Yield Topics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 80/20 rule applies—focus on topics that contribute the most to your score.
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li><strong>Reading & Writing:</strong> Main idea & inference questions (short passages), Grammar & sentence structure (concise writing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Math:</strong> Algebra (linear equations, functions, systems of equations), Data Analysis (ratios, percentages, probability).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tip: The Digital SAT has removed obscure vocabulary questions, so focus on reading comprehension and logical flow.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">3. Take Full-Length Adaptive Practice Tests</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using official Digital SAT practice tests is crucial. The College Board’s Bluebook™ app offers real Digital SAT simulations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Take at least 3 full-length tests before your exam. Familiarize yourself with the built-in timer, annotation tool, and Desmos calculator.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">4. Develop Time Management Strategies</h2>
                    <p>The Digital SAT is shorter than the previous version, so pacing is essential.</p>
                    <p>Practice under timed conditions and use answer elimination strategies for faster problem-solving.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">5. Leverage Online SAT Prep Resources</h2>
                    <p>Students have access to excellent Digital SAT preparation courses. Some top options include:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">6. Improve Mental Math Skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the Math section allows a calculator, many students rely heavily on it. However, strong mental math skills can save time, especially for ratios, percentages, and algebraic calculations.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">7. Review Mistakes from Practice Tests</h2>
                    <p>After each practice test, analyze:</p>
                    <ul className="list-inside">
                        <li>Wrong answers—Identify patterns in mistakes.</li>
                        <li>Time spent per question—Improve efficiency.</li>
                        <li>Weak areas—Dedicate extra practice to difficult topics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">8. Build Reading Stamina</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Reading & Writing section requires quick comprehension of short, information-dense passages. Read a variety of articles, editorials, and research papers. Summarize passages to improve retention and analysis.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">9. Stick to a Consistent Study Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        Creating a structured study schedule ensures steady progress. Dedicate 1-2 hours daily for Digital SAT prep. Alternate between Math and Reading & Writing to balance learning.
                    </p>
                    <p>Use weekly goals to track improvement.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol">10. Stay Healthy and Well-Rested</h2>
                    <p>A clear mind performs better on test day. Prioritize sleep (at least 7-8 hours per night). Eat brain-boosting foods (nuts, fruits, and protein-rich meals). Practice mindfulness or light exercise to reduce stress.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
