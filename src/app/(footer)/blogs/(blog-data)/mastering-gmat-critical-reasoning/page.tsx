            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Proven Strategies for GMAT Critical Reasoning</h2>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">1. Identify the Argument’s Key Components</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                A well-structured GMAT argument consists of premises (supporting facts), conclusions (main point), and assumptions (unstated beliefs that connect premises to conclusions). Identifying these elements will help you dissect the question accurately.
                <br />
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Underline the conclusion in each passage to stay focused on the argument&apos;s core.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">2. Strengthening vs. Weakening an Argument</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                To strengthen an argument, look for evidence that directly supports the conclusion.
                To weaken an argument, identify gaps or alternative explanations that challenge the conclusion.
                For example, if a passage argues that &quot;increased exercise leads to better heart health,&quot; a strengthening answer might include a study linking daily exercise with lower heart disease rates. Conversely, a weakening answer might suggest that diet plays a bigger role than exercise.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">3. Spot Hidden Assumptions</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Assumptions act as bridges between premises and conclusions. A strong assumption, if proven false, can completely break an argument.
                <br />
                <strong>Test Tip:</strong> Ask yourself, &quot;What must be true for this conclusion to hold?&quot; The correct answer will often reveal an implicit assumption.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">4. Avoid Extreme Answer Choices</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                The GMAT favors logical reasoning over emotional or absolute statements. Beware of answer choices containing extreme words like &quot;always,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; &quot;completely,&quot; or &quot;entirely.&quot; These are often incorrect, as logical arguments are rarely black-and-white.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">5. Recognize Logical Fallacies</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Common reasoning errors in GMAT arguments include:
                <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                    <li>Correlation vs. Causation: Just because two events occur together doesn&apos;t mean one caused the other.</li>
                    <li>Overgeneralization: Drawing broad conclusions from limited evidence.</li>
                    <li>Circular Reasoning: Using the conclusion as evidence.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">6. Eliminate Wrong Answers Efficiently</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Use the Process of Elimination (POE) to rule out incorrect choices:
                <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                    <li>If an answer choice contradicts the passage, eliminate it.</li>
                    <li>If it introduces new, unrelated information, it’s likely incorrect.</li>
                    <li>If it fails to address the argument’s main point, discard it.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">7. Practice Under Timed Conditions</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Time management is crucial in GMAT Verbal. Aim to spend 1.5 to 2 minutes per Critical Reasoning question. Timed practice will help you get accustomed to real exam pressure and improve your efficiency.
            </p>
