                Preparing for the Digital SAT (DSAT) is no longer just about memorizing formulas and vocabulary—it requires a well-structured study plan, time management strategies, and adaptive test-taking techniques. The DSAT is shorter, adaptive, and taken on a computer, making it essential for students to prepare strategically.
                So, when should you start studying for the SAT? And how can you maximize your score without last-minute cramming?
                This month-by-month SAT preparation timeline will guide you on when and how to start studying to achieve your target SAT score.
