            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Introduction: Overcoming the Fear of Difficult Questions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Difficult questions can create anxiety, especially when time is ticking.

With the right strategies, you can face these challenges head-on, knowing how to manage your time and boost your accuracy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> The Right Mindset: Your Secret Weapon</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Before jumping into any strategy, it’s essential to adopt the right mindset:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li><strong>Stay Calm and Collected:</strong> Anxiety can cloud judgment. Take deep breaths and focus on logical reasoning.</li>
                <li><strong>Embrace the Challenge:</strong> See difficult questions as opportunities to showcase your problem-solving abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Your Preparation:</strong> Confidence comes from consistent practice and learning from past mistakes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Time Management: Prioritizing Questions Efficiently</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Proper time management ensures you don’t waste precious minutes on a single question. Here&apos;s how you can maximize your time:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">1. Tackle Easy Questions First</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Skim through the entire section and answer the easy questions right away. This approach boosts your confidence and leaves more time for tricky ones later.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">2. Set Time Limits for Each Question</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Assign a maximum time limit per question based on the total time available. If a question takes too long, flag it and move on. Come back to it if time permits.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">3. Use the Process of Elimination (POE)</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                For multiple-choice questions, eliminate the obviously incorrect answers first. This increases your chances of selecting the correct answer, even if you&apos;re unsure.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Breaking Down Complex Questions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Complex questions can seem intimidating, but breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces will make them easier to handle:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">1. Read the Question Carefully</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Misinterpretation can lead to wasted time. Carefully read each question to identify key terms, instructions, and constraints. Rephrase it in simpler terms to clarify the goal.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">2. Identify Patterns and Logical Clues</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Many difficult questions have hidden clues within the passage, data, or prompt. Identifying these clues and patterns helps narrow down the options faster.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">3. Skip and Return if Needed</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                If a question is taking too long, move forward and revisit it later. This ensures you maximize your chances of completing the exam.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Logical Shortcuts to Save Time</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Sometimes, you don&apos;t need to perform full calculations or extensive analyses. Logical reasoning and estimation can help you arrive at the correct answer much faster:
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">1. Use Approximation Techniques</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                For questions involving numbers, try rounding values and estimating answers. If two choices are close, a quick check with rough calculations will confirm the right one.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-headingcol mb-4">2. Infer from the Given Information</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Often, the answer can be inferred from clues in the text, graph, or answer choices. Rely on logical deductions to quickly find the correct response.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Maintaining Composure Under Pressure</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Time constraints can increase stress, but staying composed is essential:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li><strong>Take Strategic Pauses:</strong> A few deep breaths can help refocus your mind and prevent mistakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Overthinking:</strong> If your answer feels right after a logical review, trust your instincts. Constantly second-guessing increases error rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Like any skill, mastering the art of tackling tough questions requires consistent practice:
            </p>
