                Before diving into preparation, it’s crucial to understand the exam format:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5 text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Integrated Reasoning (IR)</strong>: Tests your ability to analyze data and make informed decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Verbal Reasoning</strong>: Evaluates reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantitative Reasoning</strong>: Assesses basic math concepts, problem-solving, and data interpretation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                🔍 Many test-takers focus too much on their strengths, but improving weak areas is key to boosting your EA score.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5 text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <li>Take a diagnostic test to assess your performance in each section.</li>
                <li>Identify topics where you struggle and dedicate extra time to mastering them.</li>
                <li>Review errors carefully and learn from mistakes to avoid repeating them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">

                <li>Online platforms and mobile apps simulate real test conditions.</li>
                <li>Stick to the EA framework—third-party materials may not always reflect the actual difficulty level.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5 text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <li>Practice under timed conditions to improve your pacing.</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                📌 Tip: Many students underestimate time constraints—train yourself to answer strategically under pressure.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">Step 8: Keep Your Stress in Check</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                🔄 As the exam approaches, focus on revision and strategy refinement rather than learning new concepts.
