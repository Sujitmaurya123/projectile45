                How to Avoid Common Pitfalls in GMAT Focus Edition – Data Insights Section
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Data Insights (DI) section in the GMAT Focus Edition is a game-changer! It assesses your ability to analyze data, recognize patterns, and draw logical conclusions—without relying on extensive calculations. However, many test-takers fall into common traps that cost them valuable points. Understanding these pitfalls and learning how to navigate them effectively can give you a significant edge in your GMAT preparation.

            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Pitfall #1: Misinterpreting Graphs & Charts</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Skimming through graphs too quickly, leading to misreading trends or scales.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Always analyze axes, units, and labels before answering.</li>
                <li> Identify key patterns, such as increasing/decreasing trends and relationships between data points.</li>
                <li> For scatter plots, observe clusters and outliers before selecting an answer.</li>
                <li> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never assume missing data means &quot;zero&quot;—the GMAT often tests your ability to make logical inferences!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Pitfall #2: Overcomplicating Multi-Source Reasoning (MSR) Questions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Trying to digest all information at once, leading to confusion and wasted time.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Read the question first to understand what information is needed.</li>
                <li> Treat each source as an independent data point—don&apos;t assume connections unless explicitly stated.</li>
                <li> Watch for contradictory information—GMAT loves to trick you with conflicting statements!</li>
                <li> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Focus on logical conclusions rather than assumptions—GMAT never tests opinions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Pitfall #3: Failing to Spot Relationships in Table Analysis</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Trying to calculate exact values instead of recognizing relative comparisons.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Use sorting and filtering functions effectively to identify trends and rankings.</li>
                <li> Pay close attention to row/column headers before diving into details.</li>
                <li> Eliminate extreme answer choices first—they are often meant to distract you!</li>
                <li> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If a question asks for a Yes/No answer, test edge cases to confirm your reasoning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Pitfall #4: Guessing Too Soon on Two-Part Analysis (TPA) Questions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Answering each column separately instead of understanding their interrelationship.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> Identify the relationship between the two parts (e.g., revenue vs. cost, speed vs. time).</li>
                <li> Work backwards—sometimes solving one part first helps determine the second.</li>
                <li> Eliminate answer choices that contradict each other—GMAT frequently sets up such distractors.</li>
                <li> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Be mindful of units of measurement—mixing them up is a common GMAT trap!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Pitfall #5: Poor Time Management on DI Questions</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>Common Mistake:</strong> Spending too much time on complex data sets or unnecessary calculations.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong> If you’re stuck for more than 90 seconds, flag the question and move on—GMAT DI is about efficiency!</li>
                <li> Use quick elimination techniques—cross out extreme/illogical answer choices.</li>
                <li> Prioritize high-confidence questions first to build momentum before tackling tougher ones.</li>
                <li> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Set a mental time limit per question:</li>
                <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                    <li> Multi-Source Reasoning & Table Analysis: ~2 minutes</li>
                    <li> Graph-Based Questions: ~90 seconds</li>
                    <li> Two-Part Analysis: ~2.5 minutes</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Final Takeaway: Master DI with a Strategic Approach!</h2>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Read visuals carefully – Don’t assume trends, verify them.</li>
                <li> Filter & sort data logically – Focus on patterns, not calculations.</li>
                <li> Think critically, not computationally – DI is about reasoning, not just math.</li>
                <li> Manage time wisely – Don’t let one tricky question derail your pacing.</li>
            </ul>
