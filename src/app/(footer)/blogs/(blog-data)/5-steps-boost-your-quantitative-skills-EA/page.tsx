                5 Steps to Boost Your Quantitative Skills in the Executive Assessment (EA)
            </h1>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                The Executive Assessment (EA) is designed for busy professionals looking to enhance their business school applications. Unlike other standardized tests, the EA focuses on problem-solving and data sufficiency rather than advanced math concepts. To maximize your EA Quant score efficiently, you need a strategic approach. Here are five expert-backed steps to improve your EA quantitative skills.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Step 1: Master the Core Concepts (Focus on High-Yield Topics)</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                The EA Quant section does not require complex calculus or geometry but emphasizes fundamental math concepts. Prioritizing high-yield topics can help you improve your score faster.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Arithmetic: Fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios, powers, and roots.</li>
                <li> Algebra: Linear equations, quadratic equations, and inequalities.</li>
                <li> Word Problems: Work rate, distance-speed-time, and interest calculations.</li>
                <li> Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, and data interpretation.</li>
                <li> Number Properties: Divisibility rules, LCM/GCD, and prime factorization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                <strong>ðŸ”¹ Tip:</strong> Deprioritize advanced geometry and combinatorics, as they are rarely tested.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Step 2: Develop Data Sufficiency Mastery</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Data Sufficiency (DS) is a unique question type that tests logical reasoning rather than computation. To excel:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Understand the Answer Choices â€“ The same five answer choices appear in every DS question. Memorizing them saves time.</li>
                <li> Think Conceptually, Not Computationally â€“ Instead of fully solving a problem, ask yourself, &quot;Do I have enough information to answer?&quot;</li>
                <li> Recognize Common Traps â€“ Avoid assumptions and double-check constraints within each question.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                 Practice Strategy: Solve 10 Data Sufficiency questions daily and analyze your mistakes carefully.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Step 3: Train for Speed & Efficiency</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                With only 40 minutes to answer 14 Quant questions, time management is crucial. Use these techniques to improve efficiency:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Skip Long Calculations â€“ Approximate when possible to save time.</li>
                <li> Use Plug-In Numbers â€“ Substituting values simplifies algebra problems.</li>
                <li> Break Down Word Problems â€“ Convert them into equations systematically.</li>
                <li> Estimate First, Then Solve â€“ Quickly eliminate unreasonable answer choices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                 <strong>Time Drill:</strong> Set a 2-minute timer per question to track where you slow down and refine your approach accordingly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Step 4: Strengthen Mental Math & Shortcuts</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Since excessive reliance on a calculator can slow you down, improving mental math is essential. Incorporate these techniques:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Memorize Squares & Cubes (1â€“20) â€“ Quick recall speeds up problem-solving.</li>
                <li> Master Percentage Conversions â€“ (e.g., 37.5% = 3/8, 62.5% = 5/8)</li>
                <li> Use Approximation Techniques â€“ (e.g., 49.7% of 200 is approximately 100.)</li>
                <li> Apply Common Shortcuts â€“ (e.g., Digit cancellation in fractions.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Practice quick mental calculations dailyâ€”whether estimating grocery bills or calculating discounts.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4">Step 5: Take Targeted Practice & Adaptive Mocks</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                The EA is an adaptive test, so itâ€™s essential to simulate real exam conditions when practicing.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Use Official EA Questions â€“ These closely mirror real test difficulty.</li>
                <li> Take Section-Adaptive Mock Tests â€“ This prepares you for the actual exam format.</li>
                <li> Analyze Weaknesses â€“ Maintain an error log to track patterns and improvements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                 <strong>Strategy:</strong> Start by prioritizing accuracy over speed, then gradually increase your pacing.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Final Takeaway: Study Smart, Not Just Hard!</h2>
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li> Master the basics â€“ Focus on arithmetic, algebra, and data sufficiency.</li>
                <li> Think strategically â€“ EA Quant is more about logical reasoning than complex calculations.</li>
                <li> Use time wisely â€“ Don&apos;t get stuck on difficult questions; move forward efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
