            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the GMAT Focus Edition Structure</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                Understanding the exam&apos;s format is crucial for effective preparation. The GMAT Focus Edition comprises:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li><strong>Quantitative Reasoning:</strong> 21 questions in 45 minutes, concentrating on problem-solving without data sufficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Verbal Reasoning:</strong> 23 questions in 45 minutes, focusing on reading comprehension and critical reasoning, excluding sentence correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Insights:</strong> 20 questions in 45 minutes, replacing Integrated Reasoning; includes data sufficiency, multi-source reasoning, and graphical analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                Key Changes: The exam duration is now 2 hours and 15 minutes, the AWA section has been removed, and geometry is no longer part of the Quantitative section.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6">Step 2: Establish Your Target Score and Timeline</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                Determine the GMAT scores required by your desired MBA programs. For elite business schools, a score of 700 or higher is often expected. Plan your preparation over 6 to 12 weeks, depending on your initial diagnostic test results. Utilize the GMAT Official Practice Tests (Focus Edition) available on mba.com for an accurate assessment.
