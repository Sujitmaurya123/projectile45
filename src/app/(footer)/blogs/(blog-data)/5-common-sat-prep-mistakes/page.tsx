            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸ“Œ Mistake #1: Not Understanding the Digital SAT Format</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why This Hurts Your Score:</strong> The new SAT format is adaptive, meaning your performance in Module 1 determines the difficulty level of Module 2. Additionally:
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Reading & Writing passages are shorter, requiring efficient skimming.</li>
                    <li>The Math section allows a calculator throughout, including a built-in Desmos graphing calculator.</li>
                    <li>Time management is key, as the SAT is now only 2 hours and 14 minutes long.</li>
                </ul>
                Many students fail to prepare for this digital shift, leading to confusion and poor time management on test day.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid This Mistake:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Take official practice tests on Bluebookâ„¢ (College Boardâ€™s official app) to get comfortable with the adaptive digital format.</li>
                    <li>Learn how adaptive testing worksâ€”scoring well in Module 1 boosts your chance of seeing easier questions in Module 2.</li>
                    <li>Get familiar with SAT digital tools, like the on-screen timer, annotation feature, and Desmos calculator.</li>
                    <li>Join Projectile 45â€™s SAT coaching program, which offers structured training on digital SAT strategies and full-length mock tests to simulate the real exam.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> Take at least three full-length SAT practice tests before the actual exam to build confidence.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸ“Œ Mistake #2: Relying on Memorization Instead of Strategies</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why This Hurts Your Score:</strong> The SAT doesnâ€™t test pure memorization. Many students waste hours memorizing vocabulary words and math formulas without actually mastering problem-solving techniques.
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Reading & Writing: The SAT focuses on context-based comprehension rather than vocabulary memorization.</li>
                    <li>Math: It tests critical thinking, not just formulas.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid This Mistake:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>For Reading & Writing, practice active reading techniques instead of memorizing word lists.</li>
                    <li>For Math, focus on problem-solving techniques and shortcut strategies rather than blindly memorizing formulas.</li>
                    <li>Use elimination strategiesâ€”many SAT questions can be solved quickly without full calculations.</li>
                    <li>Enroll in Projectile 45â€™s SAT prep program, where expert tutors simplify complex concepts and teach exam-specific strategies for better retention.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> Instead of cramming 100+ vocabulary words, practice understanding word meanings in context through sample passages.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸ“Œ Mistake #3: Poor Time Management</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why This Hurts Your Score:</strong> With the Digital SAT being shorter, students often:
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Spend too much time on difficult questions, leaving easier ones unanswered.</li>
                    <li>Overanalyze Reading & Writing passages, reducing efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Fail to practice under timed conditions, leading to panic on test day.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid This Mistake:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Use the two-pass strategyâ€”answer easy and medium questions first, then tackle harder ones later.</li>
                    <li>Practice under real test conditions with a countdown timer.</li>
                    <li>Master efficient skimming techniques for Reading & Writing to avoid overanalyzing shorter passages.</li>
                    <li>Take expert-led practice sessions at Projectile 45 online tuition to build speed and accuracy in answering SAT questions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> In Math, donâ€™t waste time on a single tough problemâ€”use strategic guessing and move on.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸ“Œ Mistake #4: Not Reviewing Mistakes Properly</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why This Hurts Your Score:</strong> Taking practice tests without reviewing mistakes is ineffective. If you donâ€™t analyze why you got an answer wrong, youâ€™re likely to repeat the same errors on test day.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid This Mistake:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Keep an SAT error logâ€”record your mistakes and classify them as:
                        <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                            <li>Misread question</li>
                            <li>Concept gap</li>
                            <li>Careless mistake</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reattempt incorrect questions a few days later to reinforce learning.</li>
                    <li>Work with an SAT tutor from Projectile 45, who provides personalized feedback and helps you identify and fix recurring mistakes.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> Spend twice as much time reviewing mistakes as you do taking new practice tests.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸ“Œ Mistake #5: Taking Too Many Full-Length Tests Without Targeted Practice</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why This Hurts Your Score:</strong> Many students believe that taking multiple full-length tests will improve their score. However, without focused practice, simply taking more tests doesnâ€™t lead to significant score improvements.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid This Mistake:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Follow a balanced SAT study plan:
                        <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                            <li>1 full-length SAT test per week.</li>
                            <li>3â€“4 days of targeted concept revision.</li>
                            <li>Focused practice on weaker sections before taking another test.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use section-wise drills to strengthen weak areas instead of blindly repeating full-length exams.</li>
                    <li>Get structured coaching through Projectile 45 online tuition, which provides customized study plans and expert guidance for efficient preparation.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</strong> If SAT Math is your weak area, dedicate extra time to:
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Algebra</li>
                    <li>Word problems</li>
                    <li>Percentages and problem-solving</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">ðŸŽ¯ Final Takeaway: Smart Preparation = Higher SAT Scores!</h2>
