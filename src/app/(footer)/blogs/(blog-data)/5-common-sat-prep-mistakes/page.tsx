                5 Common SAT Prep Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
            </h1>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Preparing for the Digital SAT (DSAT) is a challenging yet rewarding process when approached strategically. Many students, however, make avoidable mistakes that negatively impact their scores. If you&apos;re aiming for a high SAT score, avoid these five common mistakes and use expert SAT prep resources like Projectile 45 online tuition for guided learning.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">1. Not Understanding the Digital SAT Format</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why It&apos;s a Problem:</strong> The SAT is now adaptive, meaning your performance in Module 1 affects the difficulty of Module 2. The Reading & Writing section has shorter passages, and the Math section allows a calculator throughout, including a built-in Desmos graphing calculator. Without proper preparation, students find the format confusing and struggle with time management.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Take official practice tests on Bluebookâ„¢ (College Boardâ€™s official app) to get used to the digital format.</li>
                    <li>Understand adaptive testing mechanicsâ€”accuracy in Module 1 influences how tough Module 2 will be.</li>
                    <li>Familiarize yourself with digital tools such as the annotation feature, on-screen timer, and Desmos calculator.</li>
                    <li>Consider professional SAT coaching through Projectile 45 online tuition, which provides structured training on digital SAT strategies.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip:</strong> Take at least three full-length SAT practice tests before the actual exam to gain confidence.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">2. Memorizing Instead of Using Strategies</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why It&apos;s a Problem:</strong> The SAT doesn&apos;t test memorizationâ€”it evaluates reasoning, logic, and application skills. Students often waste time memorizing vocabulary words and math formulas instead of mastering problem-solving techniques.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>For Reading & Writing, focus on active reading strategiesâ€”use context clues instead of memorizing word lists.</li>
                    <li>For Math, prioritize problem-solving skills and shortcut techniques rather than blindly memorizing formulas.</li>
                    <li>Use elimination strategiesâ€”many SAT questions can be answered quickly without full calculations.</li>
                    <li>Join a structured SAT program like Projectile 45, where tutors break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand techniques.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip:</strong> Instead of memorizing a 100+ word vocabulary list, practice context-based comprehension in sample passages.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">3. Poor Time Management</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why Itâ€™s a Problem:</strong> The Digital SAT is shorter (only 2 hours and 14 minutes), making pacing essential. Many students spend too much time on difficult questions, leaving easier ones unanswered.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Use the two-pass strategy: Answer easy and medium questions first, then return to harder ones if time allows.</li>
                    <li>Practice under timed conditionsâ€”use a countdown timer to simulate real test constraints.</li>
                    <li>Master efficient skimming techniques for Reading & Writing sectionsâ€”since passages are shorter, overanalyzing wastes time.</li>
                    <li>Take expert-led practice sessions at Projectile 45 online tuition to build your test-taking speed and accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip:</strong> In Math, donâ€™t get stuck on one problemâ€”use strategic guessing and move on.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">4. Not Reviewing Mistakes Properly</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why Itâ€™s a Problem:</strong> Taking practice tests is not enough if you don&apos;t review mistakes. Without analyzing errors, students repeat the same mistakes on the actual SAT.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Maintain an SAT error logâ€”write down mistakes and categorize them (misread question, concept gap, careless mistake, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Reattempt incorrect questions after a few days to ensure you&apos;ve learned from them.</li>
                    <li>Work with an SAT tutor at Projectile 45 to get personalized feedback on mistakes and targeted improvement strategies.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip:</strong> Spend twice as much time reviewing mistakes as you do taking new practice tests.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-headingcol mt-6">5. Taking Too Many Full-Length Tests Without Targeted Practice</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
                <strong>Why Itâ€™s a Problem:</strong> Many students believe that taking back-to-back full-length SAT tests will improve their scores. However, without focused practice on weak areas, simply taking more tests does not lead to significant improvement.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>How to Avoid It:</strong>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>Follow a balanced study plan:</li>
                    <ul className="list-inside list-disc pl-5">
                        <li>Take one full-length test per week.</li>
                        <li>Dedicate three to four days per week to focused concept revision.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Use targeted practiceâ€”if you struggle with a section, review concepts before taking another test.</li>
                    <li>Leverage structured coaching, like Projectile 45 online tuition, which provides section-wise drills and expert guidance.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6">
                <strong>ðŸ“Œ Pro Tip:</strong> If you struggle with SAT Math, spend extra time on word problems, algebra, and percentages before taking another test.
            </p>
