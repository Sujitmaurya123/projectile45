            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> Introduction: The Power of the Day Before the Exam</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                The day before your exam is a crucial time to prepare both mentally and physically. Instead of overwhelming yourself with hours of cramming, focus on reviewing key concepts, relaxing, and ensuring that you&apos;re in the best state to tackle your exam with confidence.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> 1. Review Key Concepts, Not the Entire Syllabus</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                It’s tempting to go through every single topic, but this approach often leads to unnecessary stress. The best strategy is to focus on the most important areas and consolidate what you already know.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Revise high-yield topics that are frequently tested.</li>
                <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Summarize key formulas, definitions, and concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Use flashcards or brief notes for quick recall.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8"><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid learning new topics at the last minute. Stick to what you already understand and strengthen those areas.</p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> 2. Rest and Sleep Well</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Your brain needs rest to process and retain information. Lack of sleep can impair memory and focus, making it harder to recall information during the exam.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside mb-8 text-lg text-gray-800">
                <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep to optimize cognitive function.</li>

                <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine, such as reading light material or meditating.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8"><strong>Tip:</strong> Going to bed early and waking up refreshed will enhance concentration and mental clarity.</p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl text-headingcol mb-4"> 3. Eat a Nutritious Meal</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-8">
                Proper nutrition plays a crucial role in brain function and energy levels. Eating well the day before ensures steady energy levels during the exam.
            </p>
