                            the SAT, or the French Baccalaureate). It is seen as not just a

                    The IB Diploma Program has a unique impact on university admissions.
                    Unlike many national exams that focus on a specific area of
                    knowledge, the IB assesses a student&apos;s abilities across a broad
                    spectrum of subjects, fostering students who are prepared for
                    interdisciplinary university education.

                            students benefit from a holistic admissions process. In
                            addition to academic performance (IB points), universities often
                            consider students&apos; Theory of Knowledge (TOK) essays, Extended
                            Essays (EE), and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)
                            achievements, which show a well-rounded development.

                            Universities often set specific entry point thresholds for IB

                            recognizing the advanced coursework. This can mean fewer
                            introductory classes, a smoother transition to university life,
                            and a more focused academic trajectory.
