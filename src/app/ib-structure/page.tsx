                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The International Baccalaureate (IB) offers a globally recognized
                    framework for education, comprising four unique programs designed for
                    students from the age of 3 through 19. The IB programs—Primary Years
                    Program (PYP), Middle Years Program (MYP), Diploma Program (DP), and
                    Career-related Program (CP)—each serve different age groups and
                    educational needs while maintaining a consistent commitment to high
                    academic standards, critical thinking, international-mindedness, and
                    holistic student development. This structure allows for a continuum
                    of learning that equips students with the tools necessary to thrive
                    in a global society. In the following sections, we will take a closer
                    look at each of the four programs and their key features.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The IB Primary Years Program (PYP)</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Primary Years Program (PYP) is the first stage of the IB continuum
                    and is designed for students aged 3 to 12. This program focuses on
                    fostering a love of learning and encourages students to develop
                    inquiry-based skills, independence, and curiosity about the world
                    around them. The PYP aims to provide students with a solid
                    foundation in essential academic subjects while also nurturing social,
                    emotional, and personal development.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    At the core of the PYP is the belief that children learn best through
                    inquiry. Students are encouraged to ask questions, explore new ideas,
                    and engage in problem-solving across various subjects. The curriculum
                    is structured around six transdisciplinary themes that are designed to
                    integrate knowledge across subject areas, including Who We Are, Where
                    We Are in Place and Time, and How We Express Ourselves. These themes
                    enable students to explore concepts and ideas that are both locally
                    and globally relevant, encouraging them to connect their learning to
                    real-world contexts.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    In addition to academic subjects, the PYP places a strong emphasis on
                    developing skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, and
                    communication. The program encourages students to become responsible,
                    compassionate, and lifelong learners, who are aware of their role as
                    global citizens.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    By the end of the PYP, students are expected to have developed a range
                    of skills that lay the foundation for the MYP. The focus on
                    inquiry-based learning, personal development, and
                    international-mindedness helps shape students into well-rounded
                    individuals ready for the next stage in their educational journey.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The IB Middle Years Program (MYP)</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Middle Years Program (MYP) is designed for students aged 11 to 16
                    and serves as a bridge between the PYP and the DP. The MYP builds on
                    the inquiry-based learning developed in the PYP and extends students&apos;
                    academic and personal growth through a more structured and
                    challenging curriculum. It is intended to help students develop the
                    intellectual, personal, emotional, and social skills necessary to
                    become responsible global citizens.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    One of the distinctive features of the MYP is its emphasis on
                    interdisciplinary learning. Students are encouraged to make
                    connections between different subjects, understand the relationships
                    between various fields of study, and apply their learning in
                    real-world contexts. The program covers eight subject groups:
                    Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals and
                    Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, Arts, Physical and Health
                    Education, and Design. This broad and balanced curriculum ensures
                    that students receive a well-rounded education, preparing them for
                    the academic rigor of the DP.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    A key component of the MYP is the Personal Project, which is a
                    significant piece of independent work that allows students to explore
                    a topic of personal interest in depth. This project encourages
                    students to develop research, problem-solving, and time management
                    skills while fostering a sense of ownership over their learning. The
                    MYP also focuses on the development of creativity, critical thinking,
                    and reflection, encouraging students to reflect on their learning and
                    growth throughout the program. The MYP prepares students for the
                    challenges of the DP by fostering independence, self-discipline, and
                    intellectual curiosity. Through its focus on inquiry, personal
                    development, and interdisciplinary learning, the MYP helps students
                    become active and responsible learners.

            <div className="mb-8">
                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The IB Diploma Program (DP)</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Diploma Program (DP) is the flagship of the IB and is designed
                    for students aged 16 to 19. The DP is known for its rigor and
                    academic challenge and is aimed at preparing students for university
                    and life beyond. It is recognized by universities and higher
                    education institutions around the world for its comprehensive and
                    challenging curriculum, which emphasizes both breadth and depth in
                    learning.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The DP is structured around six subject groups, with students
                    required to study one subject from each group. These groups include
                    Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals and
                    Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, and The Arts. Students are also
                    given the flexibility to choose subjects based on their interests,
                    either from the arts or additional science, humanities, or language
                    courses.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    In addition to the core subjects, the DP includes three essential
                    components: Theory of Knowledge (TOK), the Extended Essay (EE), and
                    Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS). TOK is a course that explores
                    the nature of knowledge and challenges students to think critically
                    about how we know what we know. The Extended Essay is an independent
                    research project on a topic of the student&apos;s choice, designed to
                    develop research, writing, and critical thinking skills. CAS involves
                    students in a range of extracurricular activities that promote
                    personal development through creative, physical, and service-based
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The DP emphasizes critical thinking, research skills, and global
                    awareness, equipping students with the skills necessary for success in
                    university and beyond. The program also promotes
                    international-mindedness, encouraging students to appreciate
                    different cultures and viewpoints while developing a sense of
                    responsibility as global citizens.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The IB Career-related Program (CP)</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Career-related Program (CP) is designed for students aged 16 to
                    19 who want to pursue a more career-focused pathway while still
                    benefiting from the academic rigor of the IB curriculum. The CP
                    combines academic study with practical, career-related learning,
                    providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to enter
                    the workforce or continue their education in a specific career field.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The CP consists of two key components: the IB Diploma Program (DP)
                    courses and a career-related study. Students must take a minimum of
                    two DP courses, which provide the academic foundation in subjects
                    like Language and Literature, Mathematics, and Science. In addition,
                    they must complete a career-related study, which is a vocational
                    qualification in areas such as business, engineering, or healthcare.
                    This allows students to focus on a specific career interest while
                    still benefiting from the academic rigor of the IB.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    One of the distinctive features of the CP is the emphasis on
                    personalized learning. Students have the opportunity to tailor their
                    education to their career goals and develop practical skills in areas
                    such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving. The CP also
                    includes the CP core, which consists of four key components:
                    Personal and Professional Skills (PPS), Service Learning, Reflective
                    Project, and Language Development. These components aim to develop
                    students&apos; personal, professional, and academic skills in preparation
                    for the workforce or further education.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The CP provides a pathway for students who wish to combine career
                    training with academic study, giving them the opportunity to gain a
                    qualification that is recognized by both universities and employers
                    worldwide.
